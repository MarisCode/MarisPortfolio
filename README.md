# [MarisPortfolio](https://mariscode.github.io/MarisPortfolio/)

The portfolio site is a project that is constantly changing, updating and developing. I wanted to create a website that looks like me, and through which I can present my skills and interests in the IT field.

The website has been implemented from the beginning with my own hands, without ready-made page templates. Currently, I'm working on the site's responsiveness and a more comprehensive presentation of the FribaGo project.
